# Constructor-Word-Guess
A CLI-based word guess game that relies on constructors.

*Leverage Constructors for Word Guess Greatness*

**Constructor Word Guess** utilizes constructors and randomly assigned words in a clean, command line game.

## Motivation

**Constructor Word Guess** allowed me to work more closely with constructors, and modular Node.js scripting. Two different self-authored modules were created that each had very indepent tasks, and testing. The modularity was one aspect that I really enjoyed working with.

## Build Status

Complete

## Code Style

Standard

## Demo

## Tech/framework Used

Built entirely utilizing Node.js

## Features

This quick word guess game takes very little time to get started. While the terminal screen could get cluttered, there are plenty of section divisions to allow the user to identify important information. In addition, large new line breaks allow the terminal to be somewhat cleared.

## Installation

Perform either a clone or a fork by visiting [Liri Bot](https://github.com/BrantKeener/Constructor-Word-Guess). This app only requires that you npm install 'inquirer'.

## How to Use

After installation, launch your favorite terminal, head over to the folder the project is installed into, and run node index.js.
The app launches, and information is displayed as follows:
1. Word To Be Guessed -- Displays either _ or the letter (if the correct letter has been guessed).
2. Hint -- A hint that relates to the word to be guessed.
3. Incorrect Letters Guessed -- A list of letters guessed that were not correct.
4. Guesses Remaining -- How many guesses the user has left.
5. Letter to Be Guessed by User -- A user input that accepts only one letter as a guess.
